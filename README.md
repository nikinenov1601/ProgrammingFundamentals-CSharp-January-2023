# ProgrammingFundamentals-CSharp-January-2023

Programming Fundamentals with C# course is divided in two modules and involves applied learning using Visual Studio, focusing on essential topics:

1. Basic Syntax, Conditional Statements and Loops:
  - Diving into the core syntax of C# and understand how conditional statements and loops form the backbone of program control flow.

2. Data Types and Variables:
  - Exploring the diverse world of data types in C# and learn how to wield variables to manipulate and store information effectively.

3. Arrays:
  - Focusing the versatility of arrays, a vital tool for organizing and managing multiple data elements efficiently.

4. Methods:
  - Elevating code organization with methods, modular code and enhance program structure.

5. List:
  - Embrace the flexibility of Lists, dynamic containers that bring a new level of versatility to managing collections of data.

6. Objects and Classes:
  - Setting foundational knowledge on object-oriented programming, where classes and objects work together to create robust, organized code structures.

7. Associative Arrays:
  - Mastering the art of key-value pairs for efficient data storage and retrieval.

8. Text Processing:
  - Focusing on text processing techniques to manipulate and analyze strings, opening up a realm of possibilities for handling textual data.

9. Regular Expressions:
  - Lecture focused on manipulating text patterns with precision with the help of REGEX.
  
During the course of this module we were also able to participate in lectures aiming to give us foundational understadning on topics such as: 
  - Git and GitHub
  - HTTP Basics
  - HTML & CSS Basics
  - Software Development Concepts - Part 1
  - Software Development Concepts - Part 2
  - Bitwise Operations
  - Problem Solving

Upon completion of the Programming Fundamentals with C# course and successfully taken exams, we receive a Programming Fundamentals Certificate, as a testament to our newly acquired capabilities.
